# Contributing to Building Buddies API

:tada: Yay open source! :tada:


## What do I need to know before getting started?
Building Buddies is a way for neighbors to find neighbors that share the same interests. Users are able to sign up based on their apartment building and select from a list of interests. They are then able to see other users you are neighbors and their interests. You can check out the front-end for this project [here](https://github.com/laurakwhit/building-buddies).
